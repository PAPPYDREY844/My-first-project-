		</a>
		<p>Davido made history as the first Nigerian artist to feature on an official FIFA World Cup song with "Hayya Hayya" (2022), alongside Trinidad Cardona and AISHA. He further etched his name in the record books by performing at the closing ceremony of the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar‚Äôs Lusail Stadium (88,000 capacity), bringing Afrobeats to a global stage.</p>

		<p id="timeless">Davido is the first and only African artist to have all 17 tracks from a single album, "Timeless," debut in the Top 100 of the Apple Music Top Songs Chart in the UK simultaneously. This record was set with the release of his fourth studio album, "Timeless," on March 31, 2023. This feat highlights not only the global appeal of the album but also its unprecedented dominance on a major international streaming platform, setting a new benchmark for African music.</p>
		<p>Davido‚Äôs "Timeless" also broke other notable records, such as the highest first-day streams for an African album across multiple platforms (Spotify, Apple Music, Boomplay, Audiomack, and YouTube), but the Apple Music UK Top 100 sweep remains a singular achievement.</p>

While Burna Boy and Wizkid have also sold out the O2 Arena (Burna Boy in 2021 and Wizkid in 2021), Davido‚Äôs distinction lies in being the first and doing it twice in quick succession (2019 and 2022).</p>
